App that allows the user to add items that they need to bring either weekly or as a one-off and mark them as completed.

If they haven't marked everything for the day as completed and leave the house a notification reminds them to check if they have remembered everything.

___

On the home screen the user has the option to view the lists for each day, add a task or set their home location
 - Each task list shows the tasks, whether they are recurring and / or completed, and for each task gives the user the option to complete or remove them
 - Pressing add task goes to a screen where the user can input the name of the task, what day it is on and whether or not it is recurring, which is then stored when they press submit. If the task name is empty, nothing is store.
 - Pressing set home location stores the users current location as their home
   
The first time in a day the app is opened all tasks from the previous day are marked as incomplete and all non-recurring tasks will be deleted

The first time in a day the user leaves the area near the location they set as home it will send a push notification if they have incomplete tasks
